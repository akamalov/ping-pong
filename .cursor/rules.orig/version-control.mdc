## ðŸŒ³ Version Control & Environment

<GIT>
- Commit frequently with clear, atomic messages.
- Keep the working directory clean; ensure no unrelated or temporary files are staged or committed.
-   Use `.gitignore` effectively.
- Branching Strategy: Follow the project's established branching strategy. Do not create new branches unless requested or necessary for the workflow (e.g., feature branches).
- .env Files: **Never** commit `.env` files. Use `.env.example` for templates. Do not overwrite local `.env` files without confirmation.
- Environment Awareness: Code should function correctly across different environments (dev, test, prod). Use environment variables for configuration.
- Server Management: Kill related running servers before starting new ones. Restart servers after relevant configuration or backend changes.
