## 🗣️ Communication

*   Split responses if one isn't enough.
*   When providing suggestions or applying fixes, clearly indicate which you are doing (e.g., "Suggestion:", "Applying fix:").
*   Use check-ins for large tasks to confirm understanding (see `implementation-workflow.mdc` -> Interaction Guidance). 

## Lessons Learned

* Every project you undertake, you need to track the lessons learned and append these lessons learned in file called docs/planning/lessons-learned.mdc file, which will become Cursor rule filewhich will be referenced in the future projects to come.
